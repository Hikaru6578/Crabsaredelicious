# Crabsaredelicious ‼🎀
 HELLO, HELLO, HELLO THERE ‼‼‼‼ 🐧🐧🐧🐧
  I, Hikaru or Haru or Karu or Kangaroo, would love to interact with you, trust.

"But I ship siblings in genshi-" leave and don't interact with me.
Read my straw page and you may find personal detai- I mean, future sightings ‼‼ (This isn't fake trust)

Yes, THAT is indeed the link.
Why do I think crabs are delicious? No, I don't. I'm allergic to crabs, I simply thought of that name because it's the first thing that came to my mind.
Off topic but I'm diagnosed with BPD, Bipolar disorder, Anorexia and 20% Autism.. so yeah, my attitude kind of sucks, if you ask me.
BUT ‼ I'm still very very very sane and normal, so trust me, you won't deal with any difficulties on conversing with me, unless if you're a weird person who ships random shits or if you act like smartschoolboy9.
